# 24. Suggested Code Structure

For the Python version, eventually split the game into files like this:

```text
grand_lunacy/
│
├── main.py
├── game.py
├── save_system.py
│
├── core/
│   ├── attributes.py
│   ├── grades.py
│   ├── character.py
│   ├── time.py
│
├── systems/
│   ├── training.py
│   ├── combat.py
│   ├── insight.py
│   ├── bestiary.py
│   ├── magic.py
│   ├── injury.py
│   ├── reputation.py
│   ├── quests.py
│
├── data/
│   ├── species.json
│   ├── talents.json
│   ├── traits.json
│   ├── skills.json
│   ├── items.json
│   ├── factions.json
│
├── world/
│   ├── locations.py
│   ├── factions.py
│   ├── npc_generator.py
│   ├── events.py
│
└── ui/
    ├── menus.py
    ├── text_display.py
```

Do not keep everything in one file once the prototype grows.

The current prototype is fine as a starting point, but the full game needs structure.

# 25. Final Game Loop

The final player loop should look like this:

```text
Wake up
↓
Choose how to spend time
↓
Train, study, work, travel, investigate, rest, or quest
↓
Encounter people, monsters, events, or opportunities
↓
Make decisions with incomplete information
↓
Gain knowledge, injuries, skills, reputation, or trauma
↓
World updates
↓
Time passes
↓
Character changes
↓
Eventually die, retire, ascend, disappear, or leave legacy
↓
World continues
```

That is the heart of **Grand Lunacy**.

The game should not ask:

> “What level are you?”

It should ask:

> “What do you know?”
> “What have you survived?”
> “What are you naturally gifted at?”
> “What have you sacrificed?”
> “Who remembers your name after you die?”

Yes — that changes the design in a **better** direction.

So **Grand Lunacy should not be a procedural sandbox first**.

It should be:

> **A linear-ish dark fantasy text RPG with a fixed main story, hidden stat systems, branching routes, and multiple endings based on what the player learns, who they side with, who survives, and what major threats are allowed to grow.**

So the world can still feel alive, but the **main story is authored**, not random.
